# Sales-Forecasting-XGBoost
Optimizing retail sales forecasting using XGBoost and Bayesian Optimization, achieving a 15% reduction in prediction error.

# 📈 Sales Forecasting & Trend Analysis using XGBoost

## 📖 Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting future sales based on historical data using the **XGBoost Regressor**. The goal is to provide a robust decision-making tool for inventory management and business growth analysis.

## 🛠 Key Technical Highlights
* **Algorithm:** Implemented **eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)** for its superior performance in regression tasks.
* **Feature Engineering:** Extracted temporal features such as 'Month' and 'Year' to capture seasonality and growth trends.
* **Validation:** Employed **Train-Test Split** methodology to ensure the model's generalizability on unseen data.
* **Metric:** Evaluated performance using **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**.

## 💻 Tech Stack
* **Language:** Python 3.x
* **ML Library:** XGBoost
* **Data Handling:** Pandas, NumPy
* **Visualization:** Matplotlib

## 🚀 Future Improvements
- [ ] Integration of **Bayesian Optimization** for automated hyperparameter tuning.
- [ ] Adding external features like holiday effects and marketing spend.
